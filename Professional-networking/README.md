# üåê Professional Networking

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection (STAR)

- **Situation:**  
  During my WIL period, I was working independently on my project, **YeboTasks**. Although I was the sole developer, I wanted to gain insights from others who were also creating their own systems and from project managers with more experience.  

- **Task:**  
  My goal was to expand my professional network by connecting with peers and mentors who could provide guidance or feedback on effective project communication and management practices.  

- **Action:**  
  I reached out to other ICT students and project managers through class discussions and srand up meetings. I asked questions about their project timelines, client communication methods, and how they handled challenges like scope changes or technical issues. Through these exchanges, I also shared my own progress and received valuable advice that helped refine my project planning approach.  

- **Result:**  
  This networking experience taught me that connecting with others in my field can lead to shared learning and growth. I learned how to communicate professionally, seek feedback constructively, and maintain relationships that could benefit my career in the future. It also reinforced the importance of collaboration and open communication in professional settings.
