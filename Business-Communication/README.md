## üìÑ Evidence  
- Completed during my Work Integrated Learning (WIL) placement in 2025.  
- I was placed on a **university-based project** where I had to develop my own system called **YeboTasks**, a community task marketplace web application.  
- As part of the project‚Äôs documentation and presentation requirements, I created a **Business Brand Guide** that outlined the visual and written communication standards for YeboTasks.  
- The guide defined the project‚Äôs colour palette, logo usage, tone of voice, and overall branding identity to ensure professional and consistent communication.

## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection (STAR)

- **Situation:**  
  During my Work Integrated Learning (WIL), I worked independently on a university project called **YeboTasks**, which involved developing and branding my own web application. To establish a professional and consistent identity for my system, I created a **Business Brand Guide** as part of the project deliverables.  

- **Task:**  
  My task was to design and write a clear, well-structured brand guide that communicated YeboTasks‚Äô purpose, tone, and identity in a professional way. This document needed to reflect good business communication practices and could be used as a future branding reference.  

- **Action:**  
  I researched effective brand communication strategies, drafted written guidelines for tone, messaging, and logo use, and aligned them with the project‚Äôs design style. I made sure the guide was visually appealing, easy to follow, and used concise, professional language that represented the YeboTasks brand.  

- **Result:**  
  The final Brand Guide clearly communicated the YeboTasks brand identity and was included in my project portfolio. This process improved my professional communication, writing, and presentation skills, while teaching me how to express brand values and visual identity effectively through written documentation.
