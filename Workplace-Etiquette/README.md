## ‚úçÔ∏è Reflection (STAR)

- **Situation:**  
  During my Work Integrated Learning period, I was fully responsible for managing my own project, **YeboTasks**, which required a high level of professionalism and self-management. Without a traditional team structure, I needed to maintain workplace standards on my own.  

- **Task:**  
  My main responsibility was to demonstrate professional workplace behavior this included effective time management, accountability, and maintaining respectful and consistent communication with my project supervisor.  

- **Action:**  
  I developed a structured work plan that outlined my goals and weekly tasks, regularly communicated my progress, and ensured that all submissions were on time and well-prepared. I kept my digital workspace organized, used clear and respectful language in all communication, and approached my project deadlines as I would in a real workplace environment.  

- **Result:**  
  Working independently taught me how crucial professionalism and discipline are in the ICT field. I learned to manage my time efficiently, take responsibility for my own progress, and communicate proactively. This experience prepared me to handle future workplace expectations with confidence and maturity.
